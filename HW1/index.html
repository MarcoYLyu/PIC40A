    		<h3>Iliad</h3> 
			<h4>Author: <s>Euripides</s> Homer</h4>
				<p>
			Sing, O goddess, the anger of <b>Achilles</b> son of <b>Peleus</b>, that brought
			countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying
			down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures,
			for so were the counsels of <i>Jove</i> fulfilled from the day on which the
				son of <i>Atreus</i>, king of men, and great <s>Achiles</s> Achilles, first fell out with
				one another. 
				<br><br>	
				<strong>And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel?</strong> It was the
				son of <b>Jove and Leto</b>; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence
				upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had
				dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships
				of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great
				ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed
				with a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of
				all the two sons of <s>Atreus</s>, who were their chiefs. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>"Sons of Atreus,"</strong> he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods
				who dwell in <em>Olympus</em> grant you to sack the city of <b>Priam</b>, and to reach
				your homes in safety; <u>but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for
				her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.</u>" 
				<br><br>
				On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting
				the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,
				who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said
				he, "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming
				hereafter. <u>Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you
				nothing.</u> I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos
				far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting
				my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for
				you."
				</p>

				<p>
				The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by
				the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom
				lovely Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow,
				that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy
				might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple
				with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats,
				grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the
				Danaans." 
				<br><br>	
				Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious
				from the summits of <em>Olympus</em>, with his bow and his quiver upon his
				shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled
				within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as
				dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow
				in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds,
				but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all
				day long the pyres of the dead were burning. 
				<br><br>
				For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon
				the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,
				who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon
				them. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.
				<br><br>
				"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving home
				if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and
					pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader
					of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus
					Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have
					broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will
					accept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take
					away the plague from us." 
					<br><br>
					With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of
					augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He
					it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to <em>Ilius</em>, through
					the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With
					all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus: 
					<br><br>
					"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of
					King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear
					that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that
					I shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the
					Achaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger
					of a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge
					till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will
					protect me."

				<p>
			<strong>Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
			after he had sacked the famous town of Troy</strong>. Many cities did he 
			visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was 
			acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own 
			life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save 
			his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle 
			of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. 
			Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever 
			source you may know them.
			<br><br>
			So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home 
			except <b>Ulysses</b>, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and 
			country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large
			cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time 
			when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however,
			 when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; 
			 nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, 
			 who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.
			<br><br>
			Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and 
			lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there 
			to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival;
			 but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and 
			 men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been 
			 killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:
			<br><br>
			"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing 
			but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to 
			Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew
			it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to
			do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his 
			revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him 
			this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for 
			everything in full."
			<br><br>
			Then <strong>Minerva</strong> said, <u>"Father, <i>son of Saturn</i>, King of kings, it served 
			Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but 
			Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart 
			bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, 
			far away, poor man, from all his friends.</u> It is an island covered with 
			forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, 
			daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, 
			and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. 
			This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps 
			trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, 
			so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once 
			more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, 
			and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many 
			a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?"
			<br><br>
			And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget 
			Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal
			 in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, 
			 however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded 
			 an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune 
			 by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though 
			 he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him 
			 from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how 
			 we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we 
			 are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."
			<br><br>
			And <strong>Minerva</strong> said, "<u>Father, <i>son of Saturn</i>, King of kings, if, then, 
			the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send 
			Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our 
			minds and that he is to return.</u> In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, 
			to put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to 
			call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his 
			mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep 
			and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if
			 he can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for 
			 this will make people speak well of him."
			<br><br>
			So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, 
			imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; 
			she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy 
			and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have 
			displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost summits of 
			<em>Olympus</em>, whereon forthwith she was in <em>Ithaca</em>, at the 
			gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief 
			of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There 
			she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which 
			they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the 
			house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon 
			them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, 
			some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out 
			again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Telemachus</strong> saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily 
			among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send 
			them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be 
			honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he 
			caught sight of <strong>Minerva</strong> and went straight to the gate, for he was 
			vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took 
			her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome," 
			said he, "to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall 
			tell us what you have come for."
			<br><br>
			He led the way as he spoke, and <strong>Minerva</strong> followed him. When they were 
			within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a 
			strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy 
			father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which 
			he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, 
			and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, 
			that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and 
			insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.
			<br><br>
			A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer 
			and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and 
			she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them 
			bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the 
			house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and 
			set cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them 
			wine and poured it out for them.
			<br><br>
			Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and 
			seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids 
			went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls 
			with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things 
			that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and 
			drink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning 
			embellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, 
			whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched 
			his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to <strong>Minerva</strong>, with his 
			head close to hers that no man might hear.
